Generative AI uses human input as data, essentially running statistical averages of all of the information that it gets access to. I suspect that this could be a reason for Gemini's higher accuracy - that it's more experienced. When it comes to statements such as \"Why does he not get a real job,\" Gemini might've understood the nuances better than Perspective.\n",

Bias was introduced from the fact that I manually created the dataset. The degree of difficulty of coming up with statements for me would've depended on what I had personally been exposed to or heard, and definitely would be a source of bias.\n",

    "Perspective API predicts the perceived impact a string of text may have on a conversation, and that's how it gets its toxicity score. It defines toxicity (its main attribute) as \"a rude, disrespectful, or unreasonable comment that is likely to make you leave a discussion.\" When prompting Gemini for a toxicity score, the prompt was very basic and vague. Gemini was not given a formal definition for being \"toxic,\" which is most likely why the two APIs varied so much. Gemini's definition of what was toxic or non-toxic was most likely a conclusion it came to itself based off of all the text its ever analyzed."
